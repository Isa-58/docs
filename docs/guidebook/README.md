# Guidebook

This is the Solar Developer Guidebook. After reading this, you'll be ready to build your own Solar-powered applications and blockchains -- perhaps with the help of some code from our tutorials.

The guidebook contains technical references and in coding tutorials that might overwhelm beginners. Solar community developers and the Solar Team can be contacted on [telegram](https://t.me/Solar). Do not hesitate to contact us, even if you feel the question is quite stupid and would inconvenience us.

If you intend to contribute to Solar, make sure you read the guidelines on proper [git](/guidebook/contribution-guidelines/git-commit-guidelines.md) usage and [ask](https://t.me/Solar) in advance if the Solar Team is working on a particular feature. It is better to first discuss a non-trivial change before jumping into coding it.
