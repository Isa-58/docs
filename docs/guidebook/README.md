# Guidebook

This is the Swipechain Developer Guidebook. After reading this, you'll be ready to build your own Swipechain-powered applications and blockchains -- perhaps with the help of some code from our tutorials.

The guidebook contains technical references and in coding tutorials that might overwhelm beginners. Swipechain community developers and the Swipechain Team can be contacted on [telegram](https://t.me/Swipechain). Do not hesitate to contact us, even if you feel the question is quite stupid and would inconvenience us.

If you intend to contribute to Swipechain, make sure you read the guidelines on proper [git](/guidebook/contribution-guidelines/git-commit-guidelines.md) usage and [ask](https://t.me/Swipechain) in advance if the Swipechain Team is working on a particular feature. It is better to first discuss a non-trivial change before jumping into coding it.
