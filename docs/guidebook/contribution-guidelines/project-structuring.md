# Project Structuring

While the following guidelines are not an absolute requirement, writing your code by these standards will ensure greater compatibility with the Swipechain and increases the likelihood your pull request will be accepted.

## How to Approach `JavaScript` Projects

### Dependencies

Make sure that all the dependencies you use are maintained and receive new releases on a regular basis. Also, try to use [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) now and then to check for outdated dependencies in your package.

### Directory Structure

- `lib/` is intended for code that can run as-is with `require()`.
- `src/` is intended for code that needs to be built with webpack before it can be used.
- `build/` is for webpack scripts needed to build your project.
- `dist/` is for compiled modules that can be used with other systems.
- `bin/` is for any executable scripts, or compiled binaries used with, or built from your module.
- `__tests__/` is for all of your tests with [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).

#### Lib

If you are developing a module only for server-side use with node.js, your project files should be placed in the `lib` directory.

#### src

If you are developing a module for server-side or browser use, your project files should be placed in the `src` directory.

#### Build

If you are building a module that needs to run both in the browser and on a server, you should use [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) and place the build scripts inside the `build` directory.

#### Dist

If you're using Webpack to bundle your assets, the output should be placed in the `dist` directory.

#### Bin

The `bin` folder is for any system modules your package will use or generate, including:

- The compiled `node_gyp` output for your module's binary code.
- Pre-compiled platform binaries.
- [package.json/bin](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bin) scripts for your module.
