# Events

Effective integrations in your backend can be achieved using events, similar to how webhooks work. An event emitter will inform you about any events that could require actions to be performed like missing a block, saving you from repeatedly querying the API.

## Emitting Events

Emitting events is pretty straightforward. Just resolve the `event-emitter` from `@swipechain/core-container` and call the `emit` method with a name and data to be emitted.

```js
const container = require("@swipechain/core-container");
const emitter = container.resolvePlugin("event-emitter");

emitter.emit("block.forged", {
  id: "fake-id",
  generatorPublicKey: "fake-generator-public-key",
  amount: 10
});
```

## Listening to Events

Listening to events is as straightforward as emitting them. Just resolve the `event-emitter` from `@swipechain/core-container` and call the `on` method with a name and then process the incoming data.

```js
const container = require("@swipechain/core-container");
const emitter = container.resolvePlugin("event-emitter");

emitter.on("block.forged", block => {
  if (block.generatorPublicKey === "fake-generator-public-key") {
    console.log(`You just forged a block for ${block.amount} Swipechain`);
  }
});
```
