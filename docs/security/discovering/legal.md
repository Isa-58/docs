# Legal Consequences to Hacking

Although the blockchain environment has been riddled with hacks, theft and security vulnerabilities, we would like to remind you that the same penalties exist for hacking a bank, as for hacking a cryptocurrency exchange or blockchain network.

It might seem attractive to some to exploit a critical vulnerability. The consequences are often in accordance with regular financial crimes, such as [imprisonment](https://www.ccn.com/chinese-police-arrest-hackers-behind-87-million-cryptocurrency-theft/).

Attempting to verify a theoretical disclose on the `mainnet` is not allowed, as it is in use and transmits actual value. If you need to validate and test your assumptions; read up on [How to Test for Vulnerabilities](/security/discovering/testing.md) before attacking our network.
