## Swap Procedure

Currently, the swap is only able to process transactions made with the MetaMask wallet.<br />
Read the instructions below to swap your ERC20/BEP20 SXP tokens to Mainnet SXP coins:

1. Create a mainnet address using the [Solar Desktop Wallet](https://solar.org/wallets)
2. Make sure to securely store your passphrase with additional backups. Do not share this passphrase with anyone.
3. Make sure to have the SXP tokens (BEP20 or ERC20) in your MetaMask wallet with gas to cover the fees for the swap.
4. Visit the Swap Website and make sure that you are visiting the right domain. [https://swap.solar.org](https://swap.testnet.sh)
5. Connect to your MetaMask Wallet and click next.
6. Select the network where you are holding your SXP tokens and click next.
7. Enter the amount of SXP you wish to swap. You can try with a low amount and swap more later.
