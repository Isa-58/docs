# Swipechain IoT

**Swipechain IoT** is a growing ecosystem of _"things"_ interoperability that aims to make using IoT and blockchain technology easier.

If you previously wanted to use IoT and Crypto tech in general, you had to try dozens of libraries; wasting countless hours of tweaking and debugging.
It's a lot like getting a 5,000-piece puzzle with no picture and no edges.

Much like in crypto, Swipechain's approach to a _"framework for mass adoption"_ fit's perfectly here.

Even if you have the "big picture" in your head, you may not know where to start.
Swipechain provides the "edge pieces"--or starting point--for your project; so you can spend less time debugging, and more time building.

Swipechain IoT features the first crypto SDK's designed to support IoT architecture, enabling novel use-cases on platforms with otherwise constrained resources.
