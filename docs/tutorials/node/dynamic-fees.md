# Setup Dynamic Fees

This tutorial outlines how to configure a Delegate Node to accept dynamic fees. We'll describe differences between the various dynamic fee configuration settings and explore how they can be used to run an efficient and economic node.

## Why Dynamic Fees

Although it might seem that a Delegate Node obtains the highest profit by increasing his/her fee; doing so might decrease the total amount of fees collected, as the transaction volume of the Swipechain network decreases. Dynamic fees ensure users and delegates find a natural middle ground, as Delegate Nodes compete with each other over transactions.

Dynamic fees were introduced initially in [Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Miner_fees), where it is a vital part of its mining economy.

## Finding the Configuration

Transactions are ordered by fee inside the mempool, and thus the configurations for dynamic fees are found inside [packages/core/src/config/mainnet/plugins.js](https://github.com/Swipechain/swipechain-core/blob/master/packages/core/src/config/mainnet/plugins.js) under the `"@swipechain/core-transaction-pool"` key.

## Edit Your Dynamic Fee Constants

Your node needs to signal to the network that it accepts dynamic fees. For this, open up your `plugins.js` file:

```bash
nano packages/core/src/config/mainnet/plugins.js
```

There are two separate settings here worth configuring: the `dynamicFees` constants, which is found under the `@swipechain/core-transaction-pool` key, and the dynamic fees themselves.

You can use dynamic fee constants to alter how the dynamic fee formula is applied in your Swipechain Core node. The `dynamicFees` config key in your `@swipechain/core-transaction-pool` section should look like this:

##### File: packages/core/src/config/mainnet/plugins.js

```js
"@swipechain/core-transaction-pool": {
        enabled: !process.env.CORE_TRANSACTION_POOL_DISABLED,
        maxTransactionsPerSender: process.env.CORE_TRANSACTION_POOL_MAX_PER_SENDER || 300,
        allowedSenders: [],
        dynamicFees: {
            enabled: true,
            minFeePool: 3000,
            minFeeBroadcast: 3000,
            addonBytes: {
                transfer: 100,
                secondSignature: 250,
                delegateRegistration: 400000,
                vote: 100,
                multiSignature: 500,
                ipfs: 250,
                timelockTransfer: 500,
                multiPayment: 500,
                delegateResignation: 400000,
            },
        },
    },
```

`enabled` tells our node it should store uncommitted transactions, and send them to other nodes as well. This is the primary function of Relay nodes, and on by default.

The `maxTransactionsPerSender` is a protection against spam attacks. For delegates, it might be useful to increase this value to 3000 (or their number of voters). `allowedSenders` is a specific whitelist.

`dynamicFees` is of special interest here. If `enabled` is set to `false`, your node will fall back to static fees. `minFeePool` value represents the minimum fee in Swipechaintoshi per byte a transaction should have to be included in the configured node's transaction pool. Similarly, `minFeeBroadcast` represents the minimum fee in Swipechaintoshi per byte a transaction should have to be broadcasted to peers for possible inclusion elsewhere in the network. Differentiating between these two values can allow forgers to filter out low-fee transactions from their nodes without rejecting them from the system altogether.

Below `minFeeBroadcast` you'll find the `addonBytes` object, which sets byte values to be added onto specific transaction types when calculating fees. The minimum fee calculation adds this addonBytes value to each transaction's length in bytes before multiplying by the node's swipechaintoshi-per-byte value:

```js
const calculatedFee =
  (addonBytesValue + transactionSizeInBytes) * swipechaintoshiPerByte;
```

## Changing the Transaction Pool Size

It is also possible to alter the economic tradeoff of dynamic fees by changing the maximum size of your transaction pool. The behavior specified in the `CORE_MAX_TRANSACTIONS_IN_POOL` environment variable takes effect once the pool hits the specified number of transactions.

Once that happens, your node checks the fee of each incoming transaction and only includes them in its pool of forgeable transactions if the incoming fee is higher than the smallest fee currently in the pool and evicts the smallest fee transaction from the pool to obey the cap defined by `CORE_MAX_TRANSACTIONS_IN_POOL`.

Note that, as fee transactions are only executed upon block creation, removing a transaction from the pool in this manner does not result in a charge to the "losing" transaction.

By default, the max transaction pool size is set to 100000. To change this value, edit your `.env` file or set the environment variable.

## Restart Your Node

With the node restarted, your dynamic fees should be working as intended. Feel free to test this using the utilities in `core-tester-cli` following the process in the [tester cli](/tutorials/developer/tester-cli-transaction.html) tutorial.
