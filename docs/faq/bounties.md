## Introduction

The Solar development bounty program has been updated for 2021. Previous years have taught us how to improve the program and make it more fair for participants, with revised tiers so everyone can predict their earnings. The revised program will emphasize quality over quantity.

Before pushing a PR (Pull Request), please [jump in our telegram](https://t.me/Solar) channel in order to discuss your contributions or to connect with other Solar developers.

::: tip
Solars bounty program includes all accepted PRs for [this repository]( https://github.com/solar-network/docs)
:::

### Guidelines

Issues and PRs are grouped into tiers depending on their impact, code quality, test coverage and complexity. This will bring more stability to our program and participants can anticipate how much their contributions will earn them.

You can pickup any of the existing issues on GitHub that are msolared with the `Type: Good First Contribution` or any of the `Bounty: Tier X` labels. If an issue you intend to work on is missing such a label, leave a comment to make sure no one else is working on it.

### Reward Tiers

 - `Tier 0` - Custom Reward
 - `Tier 1` - $100
 - `Tier 2` - $50
 - `Tier 3` - $25
 - `Tier 4` - $10
 - `Tier 5` - $5
 - `Tier 6` - $1

Payments will be made at the beginning of each month for the prior month and will be paid in Solar with USD valuation at the time of the payout.

## Pull Requests

Discuss your idea first before starting work on any significant new features

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features, please include tests.
