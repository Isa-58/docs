# Introduction

This section is tailored for institutional/production usage of Solar Core. Most exchanges and third-party services are familiar with `Bitcoind-RPC` when listing or adding a new cryptocurrency. Since SXP is a custom blockchain, some companies have had difficulty navigating through our GitHub and integrating Solar into their platform.

The two most popular means of accessing the Solar blockchain are via the `Public API` and the `JSON-RPC`. Though the [JSON-RPC](/exchanges/json-rpc/getting-started/) is the recommended approach, we include instructions here on how to accomplish the most common tasks on both API surfaces.

We have added "quick guides" to walk you through the process of interacting with the Solar blockchain in each API.

Use the sidebar to navigate this section.

A dedicated Promised NodeJS Module is available for exchanges that wish to you use a secure Public API for the exchange operations.

The endpoint for mainnet is https://sxp.mainnet.sh/api, please use https://sxp.testnet.sh/api" for the development network.
